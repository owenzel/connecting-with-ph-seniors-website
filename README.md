# connecting-with-ph-seniors-website

As a volunteer virtual activities director (which you can read more about in the “Service” section), one of my goals was to enable the members and staff to be as independent as possible in organizing, recruiting for, and leading their own activities. Existing tooling (Google Forms, lists, email, etc.) introduced too many barriers, both technological and administrative. So, I created a web app to address some of those pain points. I observed and interviewed members in the design phase, asked for feedback during development, and hosted the [website](https://connecting-with-older-adults.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku. (Note that the website may not be accessible when you access it due to free-tier activity limits, but you can view a demo where I discuss design considerations [here](https://youtu.be/DmG6TihJxpc).)

The website was developed using Node.js, Express, EJS template engine, Bootstrap, CSS, and MongoDB. It includes registration and login with authentication, email notifications and in-app email sending via Gmail, session storage (so that logins and selected items in a “shopping cart” persist), and more. Users can post, edit, and sign up for activities, manage RSVPs for activities they created or are leading, contact their RSVPs, submit questions, and more. Admins can manage all activities, including approving (or rejecting) activities when they are submitted by other users.
